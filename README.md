# Episode Finder

This project is the front-end of an 'episode finder' app, built as a learning project with React and Rails 5.

[The api repo](https://github.com/Obversity/what-episode-js)

The app is useless on its own without question data to go with episodes, so running the app locally won't get you much. I may host it eventually   and crowdsource questions when I'm happy with it feature-wise and code-wise.

## TODO

- authentication & authorization
- refactor with redux to learn
